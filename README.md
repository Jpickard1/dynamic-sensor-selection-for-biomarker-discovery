# Dynamic Sensor Selection

This repository implements the **Dynamic Sensor Selection (DSS)** method, as proposed in the paper: [Dynamic Sensor Selection for Biomarker Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09809). DSS is an observability-guided sensor selection method designed to identify biomarkers that change throughout time.

## Structure
This repository contains two directories:

1. `src/`: Contains Python modules implementing DSS and complementary methods such as DMD and DGC.
1. `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks to recreate the figures and analyses presented in the paper
